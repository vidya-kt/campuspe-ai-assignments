#Challenges Faced<br>
I had some confusion in pattern programs about loop structure and spaces. So i spent more time on it and also i took help from AI to learn it. In ATM program the balance was getting reset because I declared it inside the loop. Text analysis part was also a bit confusing because I had to manage multiple conditions together. In the number guessing game, handling attempts, hints, and best score together inside the loop was confusing and I had to try multiple times to get the logic correct.
