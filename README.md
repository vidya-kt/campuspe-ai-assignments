#Challenges Faced<br>
I had some confusion in pattern programs about loop structure and spaces.  
In median and mode I first forgot to sort the list and also missed the case when no value repeats.  
In ATM program the balance was getting reset because I declared it inside the loop.  
Text analysis part was also a bit confusing because I had to manage multiple conditions together.
